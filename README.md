# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION

## Project: NLP using GloVe Embeddings

## Description:

This project presents a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system leveraging GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.87%. The primary objective was to develop a robust system capable of processing and analyzing textual data using state-of-the-art techniques.

Utilizing pre-trained GloVe word embeddings, the system encodes text data and trains machine learning models for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition. As the sole developer, responsibilities included data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

The high accuracy attained underscores the effectiveness of GloVe embeddings in capturing semantic relationships within textual data, making it a valuable tool for NLP tasks.

## Fake News Detection Dataset:

For the Fake News Detection task, the project utilized a dataset containing labeled news articles, with each article classified as either real or fake. The dataset comprises textual content along with corresponding labels, allowing the NLP system to learn patterns and characteristics associated with fake news articles.

Data preprocessing techniques were applied to clean and prepare the dataset for training, ensuring optimal performance of the machine learning models. The trained models were then evaluated using real-world data to assess their effectiveness in accurately detecting fake news articles.

The utilization of GloVe embeddings proved beneficial in capturing nuanced semantic features, contributing to the high accuracy achieved in identifying fake news articles within the dataset.
